# we are very serious, we _want_ Arctica Greeter as LightDM greeter!!!
# Actually, we're not that serious after all. Since LightDM reads this
# configuration file independently of the selected greeter, this setting will
# always make it spawn Arctica Greeter.
# Instead, we'll let LightDM figure out the greeter to use via the
# update-alternatives system.
